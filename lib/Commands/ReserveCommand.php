/**
 * Reserve command
 *
 * This will return a newly-reserved job. If no job is available to be reserved,
 * beanstalkd will wait to send a response until one becomes available. Once a
 * job is reserved for the client, the client has limited time to run (TTR) the
 * job before the job times out. When the job times out, the server will put the
 * job back into the ready queue. Both the TTR and the actual time left can be
 * found in response to the stats-job command.
 *
 * A timeout value of 0 will cause the server to immediately return either a
 * response or TIMED_OUT.  A positive value of timeout will limit the amount of
 * time the client will block on the reserve request until a job becomes
 * available.
