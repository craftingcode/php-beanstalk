     * @param integer $ttr Time to run. The number of seconds to allow a worker to run this job.
     *        This time is counted from the moment a worker reserves this job.
     *        If the worker does not delete, release, or bury the job within
     *        <ttr> seconds, the job will time out and the server will release the job.
     *        The minimum ttr is 1. If the client sends 0, the server will silently
     *        increase the ttr to 1.
